# morse-passcode

Maybe TODO if this gets popular

1. passcode incorporating tap location
2. multiple passcodes granting different access

Inspired by [this CodePen](http://codepen.io/fbrz/pen/Hgqmd) by [Fabrizio Bianchi](https://twitter.com/_fbrz?lang=en)

Main differences being that this example uses React Native and takes into account press length as opposed to just taps.
